Problem Solving
I can take vague problems and requirements and break them down into steps and solutions.

Systems Thinking
I'm good at thinking abstractly and putting together systems with many moving parts.

Communicating
I can explain things clearly, communicate problems quickly and write accurately and concisely.

Organising
I can self-manage, work to deadlines, organise projects and present well-structured and complete deliverables.
